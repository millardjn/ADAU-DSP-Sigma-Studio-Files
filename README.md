I picked up an ADAU1452 DSP board paired with a CS42448 ADC/DAC and didn't find the example Sigma Studio projects for them anywhere online. I decided to google translate the files I received when emailing the vendor and put them here in case it helps anyone else.
I do not know that the executable 'USB midi配置工具.exe' is safe, and have not tested or used it myself.

In the 1452_cs42448_192 project some of the IO appeared to be labelled wrong for the board/version I bought (shown below) so I have created a new project with IO relabelled to match the pinout of the board I recieved.

If you are looking for the board I am using it can be found at the NVARCHER and BEAYEAU stores, and it seems many others, on aliexpress.
